# HTML-CSS
<h1><strong>1st level headline</strong></h1> _____ [main title. {strong} is an element that represents strong importance/urgency]
<h2><em>2nd level headline</em></h2> _____ [Subtitle usually smaller and maybe longer.{em} adds emphasis]
<h3><i>3rd level headline</i></h3> _____ [smaller kicker headlines and labels.{i} applies visual italics]
<h4><b>4th level headline</b></h4> _____ [the {b} is more generic/neutral]
<p>this is a paragraph</p>
HTML Lists
<ul>
    <li>flour</li> _____ [an {li} is an element, which represents a list of items]
    <li>suger</li>
    <li>baking powder</li>
    <li>salt</li>
</ul>

[after using {ul} for the list  of items we use {ol}(ordered list) to keep the items in a specific order]

<ol>
    <li>in a bowl, mix all the dry ingredients</li>
    <li>in another bowl, mix the rest</li>
</ol>

{dt} tag, stands for definition term
{dd} tag, stands for definition description
{dl} tag, represents definition lists
The tags are simply placed side by side simply because thats how a definition list is structured
In summary, we now have three types of lists in HTML: unordered lists, ordered lists, and definition lists.

<h2>HTML QUOTES</h2>
To attribute a quote we use {<em>cite</em>}
To distinguish a quote from the surrounding text we use{<i>blockquote</i>}
